The provided Java program implements a simple Food Ordering System using the Swing library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The application is structured with two main panels: a Menu Panel and 
an Order Summary Panel, both managed within a single JFrame. The Menu Panel allows users to select food items (Pizza, Burger, or Pasta) from a list represented by checkboxes,
with prices displayed alongside each option. A "Place Order" button triggers the transition to the Order Summary Panel, where a summary of the selected items and 
the total cost is displayed in a non-editable text area. The Order Summary Panel also includes a "Confirm Order" button, which, when clicked, shows a confirmation message and exits the application. 
The program uses a HashMap to store the menu items and their prices, facilitating calculations and updates. The layout ensures a user-friendly experience, with intuitive navigation between the panels.
